# King Cobra
A programming language inspired from Python's simplicity and C/C++'s speed.
The language itself is going to be JIT to start of with, and once a proof of concept is made with a 
primitive VM, the focus will be to implement KC with LLVM, JVM, or to keep it as a standalone project for experience.

This is an ongoing project that is based off of interest in compiled languages.
The book I am actively reading to accomplish this project is "Crafting Interpretors" By Bob Nystrom which he has made publicly available at: https://craftinginterpreters.com/
